        <p>This tool helps you make decisions using the Elo rating system
        <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system>originally created by Arpad Elo</a>. 
        The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in competitor-versus-competitor
        games such as chess. The Elo rating system, or a variation of it, is used in popular online games 
        such as League of Legends, Starcraft 2, and Hearthstone. Here, the Elo rating system is implemented in
        its typical form, as described 
        <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system#Mathematical_details>here</a>.</p>
        <p>Here, instead of players, we have choices. Choices start with a rating of 1500. Choices are matched up against
        one another, and gain or lose points depending on which one you choose. The greater the difference between the two,
        the greater the gain or loss of points.</p>
        <p>You are presented with two options at a time and asked to pick one. Eventually, the "best" option floats to the top.</p>
        <p>You can either create your own list of choices to choose between by entering them into the text box, or you 
        can try this tool using preset categories for food by clicking the corresponding button.</p>
        <br>
      <div id="options">
          <button id="start-button" onclick="presetCats()">Try it with preset food categories!</button><br>
          OR <br> Enter between 5 and 10 items using the text box below: <br>
          <input type="text" placeholder="Enter an item and press Enter..." id="newItem" size=50 onkeypress="addItem(event)"></input>
           
          <div id="demo"></div><br>
      
          <button id="start-button" onclick="beginRanking()">Click when finished!</button><br>
          
      </div>
      <div id="controls">
          <script type="text/javascript">document.getElementById("controls").style.display = "none";</script>
          Select the one you prefer:<br>
          <button id="leftChoice" onclick="leftChoice()">Select</button>
          <button id="rightChoice" onclick="rightChoice()">Select</button><br>
          <div id="graphDiv">
